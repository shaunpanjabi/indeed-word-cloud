# Indeed Word Cloud

Allows you to create a word cloud of jobs from a list of queries. The current behavior is to get the first 25 
job queries it finds for each of the 385 cities in the United States.

See [Indeed Python Docs][df1] for more information on the api used.

See [blog post][df2] written by me.

### Installation

You need indeed Python 2.7, requests, and Python indeed api:

```sh
$ pip install indeed
```
